# jTTS
The simplest TTS (Text to Text Speech) for Java without the need to use external libraries.
<br>
This example demonstrates how to do a basic TTS. With some improvements, you could read any text using your prerecorded voice. It is not intended to be a voice cloning model, although with a lot of time dedicated, it could read any previously generated text, alter the order of the words and be read without any problem.
<br><br>
For the demonstration, three recorded words are offered with which you can alternate their order and listen to them just as the legendary "Talk it!"
# TODO
* improve the way voice is captured.
* use an audio database with indexed pre-recorded words.
